#Practical Exercises on RAG Fusion & Multi Query Generation.

Practical Exercises
Watching people work out in the gym won’t make you fit; you must work out yourself. Here’s a rough idea of how to do that:

#1. Understand RAG & RAG Fusion
You already do; you made it through this paper. Read it again if you don’t feel like you do.

#2. Implement RAG Fusion with LangChain
Follow a guided tutorial to hone this in. I love this step-by-step code walkthrough video; it’s exhaustive and includes what you need to know.

Create a simple application that accepts user queries, generates multiple variations, retrieves relevant documents, and ranks them using reciprocal rank fusion.

#3. Experiment with Multi-Query Generation
We’ve discussed this, so let’s practice!

Exercise: Generate multiple queries from a single user input.

Task: Use an AI model to create variations of user queries.
Ex: If the input is “What are the effects of climate change?” generate related questions like “How does climate change impact agriculture?” or “What are the health risks associated with climate change?”.

Implementation: Write a script that takes a user query and outputs several variations, then tests these against your retrieval system.

#4. Reciprocal Rank Fusion Example
Exercise: Apply reciprocal rank fusion to combine results from multiple queries.

Task: Implement a function that takes results from different queries and ranks them based on their original positions in the result sets.
Here’s an example code snippet to get you started:

def reciprocal_rank_fusion(result_sets):
    # Assuming result_sets is a list of lists containing ranked results
    rank_dict = {}
    for idx, results in enumerate(result_sets):
        for rank, item in enumerate(results):
            if item not in rank_dict:
                rank_dict[item] = 0
            rank_dict[item] += (1 / (rank + 1))  # Reciprocal ranking
    # Sort results by their combined score
    return sorted(rank_dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

#5. Testing & Evaluation
Exercise: Evaluate the effectiveness of your RAG Fusion implementation.

Methodology:

Use a set of predefined queries and compare the performance of your RAG Fusion model against a standard RAG model.
Measure metrics such as accuracy, relevance of retrieved documents, and user satisfaction through feedback.

#6. Explore Advanced RAG
Exercise: Dive into advanced topics such as self-reflective or agentic RAG.

Task: Explore additional techniques such as Self-Reflection-RAG or Agentic-RAG to further enhance your model’s capabilities.
Implementation: Create notebooks that document your experiments with these advanced techniques.
