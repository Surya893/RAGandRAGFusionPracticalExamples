1.
Install libraries

!pip install transformers torch

2. Import Libraries

from transformers import RagTokenizer, RagRetriever, RagSequenceForGeneration
import torch
3. Load Models & Tokenizers

# Load pre-trained models and tokenizers
tokenizer = RagTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/rag-sequence-nq")
retriever = RagRetriever.from_pretrained("facebook/rag-sequence-nq")
model = RagSequenceForGeneration.from_pretrained("facebook/rag-sequence-nq")
4. Define the input Query

query = "What are the benefits of using renewable energy?"
input_ids = tokenizer(query, return_tensors="pt").input_ids
5. Retrieve Documents

# Retrieve relevant documents
retrieved_docs = retriever(input_ids, return_tensors="pt")
6. Generate Response

# Generate an answer based on the retrieved documents
outputs = model.generate(input_ids, **retrieved_docs)
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print("Response:", response)
Detailed Explanation
RagTokenizer: Tokenizes input queries and prepares them for retrieval and generation.
RagRetriever: Fetches relevant documents based on the tokenized input query.
RagSequenceForGeneration: A model that uses the retrieved documents to generate a coherent and contextually relevant response.
Output:
Response: The benefits of using renewable energy include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, decreasing reliance on fossil fuels, and lowering energy costs in the long run. Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power are sustainable and can help mitigate climate change. Additionally, they can create jobs and promote energy independence.
You can experiment with different input questions to see how different queries and configurations affect the output and maybe fine-tune the retriever and generator on domain-specific data if needed.
